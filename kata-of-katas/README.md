# **What is the Kata of Katas?**

The Kata of Katas is basically the [README](./../README.md) of the Code Katas repo in code form. In this kata, each `Kata` is associated to the technologies (`Language` and `Library`) they have been implemented in and that a developer can learn.  

[`Kata`](./src/main/java/bnymellon/codekatas/kataofkatas/Kata.java), [`Language`](./src/main/java/bnymellon/codekatas/kataofkatas/Language.java) and [`Library`](./src/main/java/bnymellon/codekatas/kataofkatas/Library.java) are implemented as Java Enums.

There is a single test where you have to group the Katas, find the katas common to various languages and libraries, and count the Kata by `Language` and `Library`.
